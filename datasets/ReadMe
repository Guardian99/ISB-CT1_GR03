- We we split the dataset into three distinct parts: training (60%), testing (20%), and production (20%).  

- To ensure consistency and reproducibility of results, we used a fixed random seed during the splitting process. 

- Later, the segmented datasets were saved in Parquet file format for efficient storage and seamless access during model development and evaluation.
