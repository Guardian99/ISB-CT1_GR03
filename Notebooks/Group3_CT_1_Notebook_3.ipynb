        "## Employee Attrition Prediction Web App with Streamlit and FastAPI\n",
        "\n",
        "This code creates an interactive **Streamlit** app that allows users to input employee details and get predictions on employee attrition (whether the employee will leave or stay). The app communicates with a **FastAPI** backend model, which performs the prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **FastAPI Integration**:\n",
        "   - The FastAPI model URL is read from the `fastapi_url.txt` file.\n",
        "   - The Streamlit app sends a POST request with employee details to the FastAPI endpoint for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User Input Fields**:\n",
        "   - **Education**: User selects the employee's education level (`Bachelors`, `Masters`, `PHD`).\n",
        "   - **Joining Year**: User enters the employee's joining year (range between 2000–2025).\n",
        "   - **City**: User selects the employee's city (`Bangalore`, `Pune`, `New Delhi`).\n",
        "   - **Payment Tier**: User selects the payment tier of the employee (`1`, `2`, `3`).\n",
        "   - **Age**: User enters the age of the employee (between 18 and 65).\n",
        "   - **Gender**: User selects the gender of the employee (`Male`, `Female`).\n",
        "   - **Ever Benched**: User selects whether the employee has ever been benched (binary: `0` for No, `1` for Yes).\n",
        "   - **Experience in Current Domain**: User enters the number of years of experience in the current domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction Request**:\n",
        "   - Once the user provides the input and clicks **Predict**, the app sends the data to the FastAPI backend.\n",
        "   - The model predicts whether the employee will `Leave` or `Stay`, and the result is displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
        "   - The app handles potential connection issues by displaying an error message if the API is not reachable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Execution Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **API URL Retrieval**:\n",
        "   The FastAPI URL is fetched from a file (`fastapi_url.txt`), which contains the prediction endpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Streamlit UI**:\n",
        "   - Various input fields are provided for the user to enter details about the employee.\n",
        "   - The `Predict` button sends the input data to the FastAPI service via a POST request.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction**:\n",
        "   - The FastAPI backend processes the input data and returns a prediction, which is displayed as either **Stay** or **Leave** based on the model’s output.\n",
        "   - If an error occurs during the request (e.g., connectivity issues), a user-friendly error message is shown.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "- **User Input Fields**: Employee details such as Education, Age, Experience, etc., are input by the user.\n",
        "- **Prediction API**: The user input is sent to the FastAPI model, which performs the prediction.\n",
        "- **Streamlit Interface**: The results are displayed on the Streamlit web page, making it easy for users to interact and get predictions.\n",

        "\n",
        "This code snippet runs the **Streamlit** app in a separate thread and exposes it to the internet using **Ngrok**. It enables remote access to the web interface of the Employee Attrition Prediction app, which is running on a local server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start Streamlit Server**:\n",
        "   - The `streamlit_thread` is a background thread that starts the Streamlit app (`app.py`) on port `8501` using the command:\n",
        "     ```bash\n",
        "     streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expose via Ngrok**:\n",
        "   - The **Ngrok** service is used to create a public URL for the local Streamlit app.\n",
        "   - The public URL is printed and can be shared with others to access the app remotely.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Execution Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Streamlit App**:\n",
        "   - The Streamlit app (`app.py`) is launched in a separate thread, which allows the notebook to continue executing other tasks without blocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ngrok Tunnel**:\n",
        "   - Ngrok is used to expose the locally running Streamlit app to the internet.\n",
        "   - The URL provided by Ngrok can be shared and accessed in a browser to interact with the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Public URL**:\n",
        "   - Once the Streamlit server is running, the public URL generated by Ngrok is displayed in the output. This URL can be used to access the app from any browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "- **Streamlit in Background**: The Streamlit server is started in a background thread to prevent blocking the notebook execution.\n",
        "- **Ngrok Exposure**: Ngrok creates a secure tunnel, exposing the local Streamlit app to the internet with a public URL.\n",
        "- **Accessing the App**: After running this code, the user can visit the public URL to interact with the app.\n",
