        "## Deploying a Prediction Service with FastAPI and Ngrok\n",
        "\n",
        "This section sets up a RESTful API using **FastAPI** to serve predictions from the trained machine learning model. The API is exposed to the public using **Ngrok** for remote accessibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Loading**:\n",
        "   - The trained model is loaded from a pickle file (`best_model.pkl`) stored in the Colab environment.\n",
        "   - Ensure that the file exists in the specified path before running the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **FastAPI Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The `FastAPI` application is instantiated to define and serve the API endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Input Schema**:\n",
        "   - The `PredictionInput` class (a **Pydantic** model) defines the expected input structure for prediction requests. This ensures type validation and proper request formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prediction Endpoint**:\n",
        "   - A POST endpoint (`/predict`) is created to handle prediction requests.\n",
        "   - The input data is converted to a Pandas DataFrame before being passed to the model's `predict` method.\n",
        "   - The API returns the predicted class as a JSON response.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Run FastAPI in Colab**:\n",
        "   - `nest_asyncio` is used to allow the FastAPI server to run alongside the Colab notebook environment.\n",
        "   - The server runs locally on port `8000`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Ngrok Integration**:\n",
        "   - Ngrok is used to expose the local FastAPI server to a public URL.\n",
        "   - The Ngrok authentication token is required to secure the tunnel.\n",
        "   - The generated public URL is printed for user access.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Save Public URL**:\n",
        "   - The public URL is saved to a file (`fastapi_url.txt`) for easy retrieval or use in other services like Streamlit.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Outputs:\n",
        "- **FastAPI Public URL**: https://57b4-34-55-151-170.ngrok-free.app\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits:\n",
        "- **Remote Prediction Service**:\n",
        "- Enables real-time predictions from the trained model, accessible from any device with the public URL.\n",
        "- **Validation**:\n",
        "- The use of Pydantic models ensures that incoming data adheres to the expected schema, reducing potential errors.\n",
        "- **Scalable Deployment**:\n",
        "- Can be extended or integrated with other applications for real-world use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Applications:\n",
        "This setup is ideal for deploying machine learning models for:\n",
        "- Employee attrition prediction.\n",
        "- Providing predictions as a service for other applications.\n",
        "- Quick and collaborative model testing and validation.\n"

        "## Testing the FastAPI Prediction Endpoint\n",
        "\n",
        "This section demonstrates how to test the deployed FastAPI service by sending a prediction request and reviewing the server's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Retrieve FastAPI Public URL**:\n",
        "   - The public URL for the FastAPI server is loaded from the `fastapi_url.txt` file, ensuring the correct endpoint is used for the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Prepare the Payload**:\n",
        "   - A JSON payload is defined with input data conforming to the `PredictionInput` schema. This data includes both categorical and numerical features required by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Send a POST Request**:\n",
        "   - A POST request is made to the `/predict` endpoint using the `requests` library.\n",
        "   - The JSON payload is sent as the request body.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Response Handling**:\n",
        "   - The response from the FastAPI server is parsed and printed:\n",
        "     - **Status Code**: Indicates whether the request was successful (e.g., `200 OK`).\n",
        "     - **Headers**: Provides metadata about the response.\n",
        "     - **Response Text**: Displays the actual prediction returned by the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output:\n",
        "- **Status Code**: `200` (indicating success)\n",
        "- **Headers**: Metadata, such as content type.\n",
        "- **Response Text**: JSON data, e.g., `{\"prediction\": 1}`, where `1` indicates a positive prediction for employee attrition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits:\n",
        "- **End-to-End Testing**:\n",
        "  - Verifies that the FastAPI service processes requests correctly and returns predictions as expected.\n",
        "- **Real-World Simulation**:\n",
        "  - Mimics client-side behavior to ensure the API works seamlessly for external users or applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases:\n",
        "- **Debugging**:\n",
        "  - Identifies issues in the prediction pipeline, such as mismatched input schemas or model errors.\n",
        "- **Integration Testing**:\n",
        "  - Ensures the API integrates well with client-side applications or other services.\n",
        "- **Performance Monitoring**:\n",
        "  - Evaluates response times and reliability under typical usage conditions.\n",
